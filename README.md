# Homology Modeling of nAChR a4a5b2

##### MODELLER
These restrains are myModel.py. These restraints include:

**1. Include ligand to model the binding pocket.\\
**2. Make a restraint to insure the proline in the ECD-TMD interface is in cis conformation.\\
**3. Disulfide bonds.\\
**4. Impose end of MA helix in the open state to be an alpha-helix.\\
**5. Symmetry between alpha and beta subunits.\\

Scores are: DOPE, GA341, zDOPE and procheck per chain.
